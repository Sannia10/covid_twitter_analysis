# Overview
In this analysis, twitter data is used to perform region-specific exploratory analysis
on peopleâ€™s discussion and sentiments about COVID-19 in the UK. Topic modelling and
sentiment analysis is used to unravel the intra-region dynamics. It shows that people across
different regions discuss the same topics in different contexts. The study also discusses how
sentiments of people change over time and are heavily influenced by government policies and
information on media. Overall, the proposed framework shows the potential of using twitter
analysis to assist the local authorities in designing policies for new interventions.
